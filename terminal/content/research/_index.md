# Our Research

The Kovtun Lab investigates cellular logistics, focusing on how membrane trafficking pathways maintain cellular homeostasis and how defects in these processes contribute to human disease.

## Endosomal Sorting and Trafficking

We study the molecular mechanisms that regulate protein sorting in the endosomal system. Our research has identified several key components of the machinery that recognizes and sorts cargo at endosomal membranes. Current projects focus on:

- The role of novel adaptors in cargo recognition
- Regulation of sorting complex assembly
- Coordination between sorting and membrane remodeling

This work combines structural biology, biochemistry, and advanced imaging approaches to understand the fundamental principles of endosomal sorting.

## Membrane Trafficking in Neurons

Neurons face unique challenges in maintaining proper protein distribution due to their complex morphology. We investigate how membrane trafficking pathways are specialized in neurons to support synaptic function. Ongoing projects include:

- Regulation of endocytic recycling at synapses
- Long-distance transport of signaling endosomes
- Role of local protein synthesis in endosomal function

Using cultured neurons, brain slices, and in vivo models, we aim to understand how trafficking defects contribute to neurological disorders.

## Trafficking Defects in Disease

Many neurological and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with defects in membrane trafficking. We use patient-derived cells and animal models to investigate how trafficking defects contribute to disease pathology. Current focus areas include:

- Endosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease
- Lysosomal trafficking defects in Parkinson's disease
- Development of small molecules to correct trafficking defects

This research aims to identify potential therapeutic targets for treating disorders associated with membrane trafficking dysfunction.

## Technology Development

We develop new tools and techniques to visualize and manipulate membrane trafficking processes in living cells. Our technological innovations include:

- Optogenetic tools to control protein sorting
- Live-cell reporters for monitoring cargo trafficking
- High-throughput screening approaches for trafficking modulators

These technologies enable us to dissect the complex and dynamic nature of membrane trafficking with unprecedented precision.
