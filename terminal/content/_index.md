## About Our Lab

The Kovtun Lab investigates membrane trafficking mechanisms in cells, with a particular focus on understanding how defects in these processes contribute to neurological disorders.

## Research Highlights

- **Membrane Transport**: Uncovering the molecular mechanisms of vesicle trafficking
- **Endosomal Sorting**: Studying protein sorting in the endosomal system
- **Neurodegeneration**: Investigating trafficking defects in neurodegenerative diseases

## Recent Publications

- Smith J, Doe J, Kovtun O (2025). "Novel regulators of endosomal sorting." *Journal of Cell Biology*
- Williams R, Kovtun O (2024). "Membrane dynamics in neuronal function." *Nature Cell Biology*
