I am a Professor of Cell Biology specializing in membrane trafficking mechanisms. My research focuses on understanding how proteins and lipids are transported between different cellular compartments, with a particular interest in how these processes go awry in neurological disorders.

I received my PhD from Harvard University in 2010, followed by postdoctoral training at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Before starting my own lab, I worked as a research scientist at Genentech, where I developed an interest in translating basic cell biology discoveries into therapeutic applications.

My lab uses a combination of advanced imaging techniques, biochemistry, and genetic approaches to study vesicular transport in various cell types. We are particularly interested in:

- Mechanisms of endosomal sorting
- Regulation of membrane fusion events 
- Trafficking defects in neurodegenerative diseases
- Development of tools to visualize membrane dynamics

When not in the lab, I enjoy hiking, photography, and playing chess. I am passionate about science communication and regularly participate in outreach activities to bring cell biology to broader audiences.
