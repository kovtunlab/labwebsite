I joined the Kovtun Lab in 2023 as a postdoctoral researcher after completing my PhD in Neuroscience at Stanford University. My research focuses on understanding how membrane trafficking contributes to neuronal function and dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.

My current projects involve investigating the role of endosomal sorting in maintaining synaptic health and how defects in this process may contribute to Alzheimer's disease. I use a combination of super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and molecular biology techniques to study these processes in primary neuronal cultures and iPSC-derived neurons from patients.

During my PhD, I developed a novel method for visualizing vesicle fusion events at synapses in real-time, which was published in Neuron. I am now adapting this method to study trafficking events in dendrites and how they are affected by disease-associated mutations.

Outside the lab, I enjoy rock climbing, playing the cello, and volunteering as a science mentor for high school students interested in pursuing careers in STEM fields.
