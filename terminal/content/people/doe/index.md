I am a third-year PhD student in the Molecular and Cell Biology program. I joined the Kovtun Lab in 2023 after completing my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry at UC Berkeley, where I first became fascinated with cellular logistics during a summer research project on endocytosis.

My dissertation research focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating endocytosis in polarized cells. I am particularly interested in how cargo selection at the plasma membrane is coordinated with downstream sorting events. Currently, I am characterizing a novel adaptor protein complex that we believe plays a crucial role in this process.

In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring. I serve as a teaching assistant for the undergraduate cell biology course and enjoy helping students develop their critical thinking skills. I also participate in the department's outreach program, visiting local high schools to introduce students to the exciting world of cell biology.

When I'm not in the lab, you can find me playing ultimate frisbee, experimenting with sourdough baking, or hiking in the nearby state parks.
