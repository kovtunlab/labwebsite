I was a rotation student in the Kovtun Lab during Fall 2024, where I worked on characterizing protein interactions within the endosomal sorting machinery. I used a combination of biochemical approaches and proximity labeling to identify novel binding partners of retromer components.

During my time in the lab, I learned advanced imaging techniques and biochemical assays that have been valuable in my current research. I particularly enjoyed the collaborative environment and the opportunity to participate in weekly lab meetings where we discussed recent developments in the field.

After completing my rotation, I decided to pursue my PhD research at Stanford University, where I am now studying membrane dynamics in immune cells. I still maintain connections with the Kovtun Lab and am grateful for the mentorship and training I received during my rotation.

I am currently developing new approaches to track protein trafficking in activated T cells, building on the techniques I learned in the Kovtun Lab. My research interests include immunological synapse formation and targeted secretion in immune responses.
