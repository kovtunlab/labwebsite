Our lab has recently identified a novel protein complex that plays a crucial role in regulating endosomal sorting. This discovery, published today in Nature Cell Biology, sheds new light on how cells maintain proper protein trafficking pathways.

## Background

Endosomal sorting is a fundamental cellular process that determines the fate of internalized proteins, directing them either for recycling back to the plasma membrane or for degradation in lysosomes. Defects in this process have been implicated in various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

## The Discovery

Through a combination of proteomics, CRISPR screening, and high-resolution imaging, we identified a previously uncharacterized protein complex that we've named ESCORT (Endosomal Sorting COmplexity Regulatory Team). This complex consists of three proteins that work together to recognize specific cargo and facilitate its transfer to intraluminal vesicles.

"This was quite surprising," says Dr. Jane Smith, the lead author of the study. "We knew that cargo sorting was regulated, but finding a completely new complex that plays such a central role was unexpected."

## Implications

The discovery of ESCORT opens up new avenues for understanding how cells maintain protein homeostasis and could potentially lead to new therapeutic strategies for diseases associated with trafficking defects.
