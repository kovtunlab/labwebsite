      <description>&lt;p&gt;I joined the Kovtun Lab in 2023 as a postdoctoral researcher after completing my PhD in Neuroscience at Stanford University. My research focuses on understanding how membrane trafficking contributes to neuronal function and dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My current projects involve investigating the role of endosomal sorting in maintaining synaptic health and how defects in this process may contribute to Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s disease. I use a combination of super-resolution microscopy, live-cell imaging, and molecular biology techniques to study these processes in primary neuronal cultures and iPSC-derived neurons from patients.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a Professor of Cell Biology specializing in membrane trafficking mechanisms. My research focuses on understanding how proteins and lipids are transported between different cellular compartments, with a particular interest in how these processes go awry in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I received my PhD from Harvard University in 2010, followed by postdoctoral training at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, UK. Before starting my own lab, I worked as a research scientist at Genentech, where I developed an interest in translating basic cell biology discoveries into therapeutic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a third-year PhD student in the Molecular and Cell Biology program. I joined the Kovtun Lab in 2023 after completing my undergraduate degree in Biochemistry at UC Berkeley, where I first became fascinated with cellular logistics during a summer research project on endocytosis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My dissertation research focuses on the molecular mechanisms regulating endocytosis in polarized cells. I am particularly interested in how cargo selection at the plasma membrane is coordinated with downstream sorting events. Currently, I am characterizing a novel adaptor protein complex that we believe plays a crucial role in this process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
